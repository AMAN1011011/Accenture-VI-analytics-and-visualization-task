# accenture-VI-analytics-and-visualization-task
### I just completed Accenture North America's Data Analytics and Visualization on Forage. In the simulation I:
#### Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture
#### Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions
#### Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders


### DATA CLEANING:
#### Content data set:
##### reanme type---> content type
##### remove missing or simillar values 
##### delete User ID column which looks unnecessary according to target data sets

### Reaction Data set:
#### rename type----> reaction type
##### remove missing or similar data values
##### delete User ID column which looks unnecessary according to target data sets

##### now,
##### Add a sheet in content file,
##### rename as reaction and past reaction data set
add one more sheet and rename as reaction type and paste reaction data type there
so our task is completed according to the requirement of submitting  a single data file to perform the further analysis.
